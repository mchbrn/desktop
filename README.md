# system

Source code, configs and install scripts for my system. The aesthetic for this rice was stolen from [@marcothms](https://github.com/marcothms) as seen on [unixporn](https://old.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/nths26/dwm_cs_student_went_light_mode/).

## installation

Following a base install of Arch Linux and chrooting into /mnt, running `./install` builds my entire system.
